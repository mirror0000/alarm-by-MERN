# RaspAlarm
A Raspberry Pi Controlled Alarm Clock with Alexa Integrations

# Purpose
A full feature alarm clock that can be used in the bedroom to tell the time, set alarms, show the weather and a whole slew of other, yet to be built features. 

# Why?
My girlfriend and I watched a YouTube video about how technology rules people's lives. The guy in the video mentioned that he knows couples who wake up and go through their phones before even saying good morning to each other and that this was "unhealthy". We realized we do exactly that so we thought up a solution to still have some technology in our bedroom but leave our phones in another room. 

# Technologies Used
- Javascript
- Amazon Echo API
- Weather Underground API
- React (For educational purposes)
- More to come

# Struggles
This application is still under development.
- The Raspberry Pi is throwing an "undervoltage" symbol, indicating that my power supply probably isn't enough. Plan to fix this by buying a new power supply, but will slog through for the time being. 

# What I Learned
Raspberry Pi's are cool, fun and cheap. This is my first Raspberry Pi project but will likely not be my last. 

# Status
Still incomplete. Began work on 1/7/17. 
- Raspberry Pi and touch screen are functional and running Raspbian.
